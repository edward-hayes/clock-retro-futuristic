Clock for Ventra Fitbit Style in 80s Futurism

Available for Versa2 and Sense2

Built this mostly for myself as a fun weekend project. Hope you enjoy it too!

The style I'm aiming for is maybe something you'd see in Tron or Alien. Technologically advanced, but still with an 80s UI feel. I wanted it to feel physical and old, like it's a casio watch. Got some fun 80s colors for pop.
